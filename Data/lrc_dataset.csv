Straight up, late nights mixed with early days. It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates. Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break. These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man. Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it. Realize the energy you give is what you manifested. So understand we positive as could be. The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats. Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach.

Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers. You know it's true, bitch I need respect due. Now or later, either way I'mma take it, just like it's ****in' taxes. No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch. Lately I been living life in detachment. I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions. We been all in the Hollywood hills, ain't never acting. Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion. Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies. Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body. Niggas over stressing, we under investigation. Every day off to the races, can't **** with you if you racist. Beat your ass until you purple, they can't even tell what your race is. Doctor King meet Dr. Dre, except this doctor lost all his patience.

I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back. I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that. I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate.

I know you want your privacy. And you’ve got nothing to say to me. But I wish you'd let me pay off your student loans to these songs you gave to me. Member the first time you stayed with me?. Overpacked, and drove up, and went to the CMA's with me. Two years later, it felt like you were a million miles away from me. And I was the one on stage, drunk. Barely holdin' on, on ABC. Hope your dad still prays for me. Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much. Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough. I'm on top of the world, I'm going down. I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around. Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much. Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough. I'm on top of the world, I'm going down. I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around. A year ago I was in a hotel room in Pheonix. Wonderin' if it's ever OK to lie. Cause I knew the truth would make you wanna die. But I told you everything, and you told me to have a good life. But you still couldn't believe it was really goodbye. Every night you'd fill the bathtub up. Lie there for hours, put your face under water, and cry. I never wanted to be a heartbreaker. Turn your sisters and friends into matchmakers. I know you think my dreams came true. Since you been gone. Singin' these songs are just something to do. Every dream I ever had was you. Hope you know I'm still in love. It's the kind you can't fall out of. Drinkin’ too much, drinkin’ too much. Since you been gone, I can’t get gone enough. I'm on top of the world, I'm going down. I'm gonna drink it all 'til you're not around.

State of emergency, the planets having panic attacks. Brady's returning, matter fact I may be deserving. Of a Pat on the back like a Patriots jersey. Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it.

Like a missile, a thunder cloud. 100 pound pistol pull the trigger this gun will sound. And you'll get a round like Digital Underground. And **** Ann Coulter with a Klan Poster. With a lamp post, door handle shutter. A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener, a candle rubber. Piano, a flannel, sucker, some hand soap, butter. A banjo and manhole cover. Hand over the mouth and nose smother. Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover. The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner. Go ham donut or go Rambo, gotta make an example of her. That's for Sandra Bland ho and Philando. Hannibal on the lamb, no wonder I am so stubborn. I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando. Your man don't want it, Trump's a bitch.

Females stay beatin 'em, bet you they'll lay bleeding. And yell, ""Wait!"", pleading, but screaming is pointless. Like feeding Michel'le helium. Leaving them pale faced medium sized welt.

Silence like a cancer grows."". Hear my words that I might teach you. Take my arms that I might reach you. But my words like silent rain-drops fell. And echoed in the wells of silence.

284,"Intro: The Winans. Question is will I ever leave you?. The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no. Question is will I ever leave you?. The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no. Verse 1. Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure. And my wifey is a spice like I’m David Beckham. A lot of pent up aggression coming out of my section. OVO on me while y’all niggas was playing dress-up. And I know who gon’ take the fall with me. They right here on call with me, they all with me. You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted. They been saying it’s love, but it isn’t love, is it?. Toast to the days when they wasn’t out to get me. I worked at JD’s connections whenever Jason let me. , I was buying fitteds everyday.  Kenny's caravan and trying not to catch a stray. I dropped out right before I graduate. Six credits left, my mama had a saddest day. “It’s only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”. And she took my word for it, that’s all I had to say. Lately I just feel so out of character. The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance. Thoughts too deep to go work ’em out with a therapist. I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison. I’m getting straight to the point with it. Need y’all to know that I never needed none of y’all niggas. **** being all buddy buddy with the opposition. It’s like a front of the plane, nigga, it’s all business. But I haven’t flown with y’all boys in a minute. Verse 2. Look, they’d rather run up on me than towards them goals. My niggas still hit the club when it’s 20 below. Who you think running this show?. You saw it in me at 20 years old. The lingo start to sound like we talking in code. I got a pure soul, I don’t do the hate. You don’t worry ’bout fitting in when you custom made. Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change. Now me and Kobe doing shots the night before the game. Still drop 40 with liquor in my system. Numbers going unlisted just to create some distance. I might see you on and off but I’ll never switch ya. Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian. Lamborghini got me feeling like I’m Christian Bale. And I never bare my morals for the ticket sales. Tipping scales, bars heavy like triple XL. I never tag no one in, I’d rather get you myself. Running through the 6, storming through the contracts. I’m possessed, you can see it under the contacts. They think I had the silver spoon but they’ll get it soon. I still got something left to prove since you left me room. Paint a plan for the family debt, we in the minus. And like it’s going in a trunk, I put it all behind us. Where you tryna go? I got it, I’ll take us wherever. I’m a staple in the game, all my papers together. And my life is on display like Truman. They wanna pre the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner. My exes made some of my favorite music. I dated women from my favorite movies. Karma's such a thing of beauty. I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it. It's far fetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters. I keep it 100 like I'm running a fever. I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you. If I was you, I wouldn't like me either.",0.4625,0.4875

429,"[Intro. (for your eyes). [Verse 1. *****s be dying on the daily. It seems my dreams faded for far too long, the consequences deadly. Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal. Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal. Cause young *****s is hard headed, they letting off. Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause. Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black. Plus it's hot now, the cops outside it's hard to flip a pack. And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me. Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet. Like I ain't out in the field like that. I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back. Despite the charges, back to the wall I fight regardless, Screaming ""***** the law"", my life is lawless. That's what you call it. Ain't got to be no psychic to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven. This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic. I try to find employment even if the swiper chargeless. But these felonies be making life the hardest. Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet. Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it. That's why I write this sonnet. If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break. Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it. Let her know my life is on it. (For your eyes). Let her know my life is on. For your eyes only. [Hook. For your eyes do you understand me. For your eyes do you understand. For your eyes do you understand me. For your eyes do you understand. For your eyes do you understand me. For your eyes do you understand. For your eyes do you understand me. [Verse 2. If you're hearing this unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you. In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God. But because you still alive. He got me praying that the spiritual is real. So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too. So I know how part of you feels. Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me. Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a ***** just like me. I hope not, I'm tired of **** spots. And fiends that smoke rocks, I've seen far too many *****s hopes rot. I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance. Now I see death around the corner, apologizing in advance. Don't know if I ever had a chance. At a glance I'm a failure, addicted to pu*****ng paraphernalia. But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once. Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years. My Pops shot up, drug related. Mama addicted. So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging. Blood was staining the concrete. Older *****s I loved talked like they was above maintaining a time sheet. That slow money, picked up the family business. By the age of thirteen, six years later was handed sentence. Round the same time is when you came in this world. Me and your mama thinking, what the ***** we naming this girl?. I told her Nina, the prettiest name that I could think of. For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen. I was nineteen, took me two felonies to see the trap, this crooked ass system set for me. And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be the one that set examples that was never set for me. I'm living fast, but not fast enough cause karma keeps on catching up to me. And if my past becomes the death of me, I hope you understand. [Hook. For your eyes do you understand me. For your eyes do you understand. For your eyes do you understand me. For your eyes do you understand. For your eyes do you understand me. For your eyes do you understand. For your eyes do you understand me. [Verse 3. Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout. Was it the young *****s, blasting frustrated cause the cash running out. *****s don't know how to act in a drought. See baby girl I realized, my definition of a real ***** was skewed. My views misshaped by new mixtapes. That confirmed the *****t I learned in the streets was true. That real *****s don't speak when they beef with you. They just pull up on your street, let the heat at you. And if a real ***** hungry he gon' eat your food. I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops. Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you. I pray you find a ***** with goals and point of views. Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you. Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops. And the cyclical nature of doing time continues. My worst fear is one day that you come home from school. and see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news. I got the strangest feeling your Daddy gonna lose his life soon. And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true. But maybe there's a chance that it's not. And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels. And I can teach you this in person like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes. I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you. For your eyes only. [Hook. For your eyes only. For your eyes. For your eyes only. For your eyes do you understand. [Verse 4. What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling. I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing. But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice and it was chilling. He said ""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children I never asked for nothing. When times was hard I never had discussions with you begging you to help me. I dealt with the repercussions of my actions. I know you tried to steer me 'way from that *****t. But that *****t was in my blood, you know my life. I know your Momma *****, send my love. In case I never get a chance to speak again. I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib. That's the way I wished my family lived. But my granny crib was in the 'jects. I had to interject like, ""***** what you talking 'bout? ***** is you getting at?"". He said ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions. But I've been having premonitions, just call it visions from the other side. I got a feeling I won't see tomorrow, like the time I'm living on is borrowed. With that said the only thing I'm proud to say I was a father. Write my story down and if I pass go play it for my daughter when she ready. And so I'm leaving you this record for your eyes only, don't you ever scratch or disrespect it. This perspective is a real one, another lost Ville son. I dedicate these words to you and all the other children. Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation. That sent your pops to prison when he needed education. Sometimes I think this segregation would've done us better. Although I know that means I would never be brought into this world. 'cuz my daddy was so thrilled when he found him a white girl. to take back to Jonesborough with'lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old,. now it's thirty years later making sure the story's told.
